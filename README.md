### Objecttive:
The main objective of this project was to comprehensively analyze booking cancellation trends in a European Hotel Dataset. The project aimed to identify the underlying reasons for booking cancellations and provide recommendations to the hotel to minimize losses.

### Tech Stack

- AWS S3 - Dataset location.
- R studio -  EDA, Feature Engineering, Modelling
- ggplot - Visualizations

### Recommendations:
- The few recommendations based on the results and analysis were as follows:
  
  i.	  Introducing the concept of refunds on deposits which are minimal would help in reducing the booking and increase the revenue.
  
  ii.	  Management should be accommodating to special requests that the customers are requesting for which are reasonable with proper documentation.
  
  iii.  The hotel management should take into consideration of encouraging direct booking from the hotel website rather than 3rd party vendor so that the booking goes through hassle            free, and the changes are addressed directly by the hotel and not the third-party vendors.
  
  iv.	  Especially for Group booking, offer them upgrades and free breakfast options.
  
  v.	  The hotels in Portugal had the highest cancellation rates along with highest bookings, should consider changing their business model by implementing all the findings mentioned          above to grow their revenue and minimize losses.
